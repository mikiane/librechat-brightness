<Callout type="warning" title="`docker-compose.yml` Update" emoji='🐋'>
We have made changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file to enhance the default behavior. Starting now, the file uses the pre-built image by default. If you prefer to build the image yourself, you'll need to utilize the override file to specify your custom build configuration.

Here's an example of the `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
  image: librechat
  build:
    context: .
    target: node
```

For more detailed information on using the `docker-compose.override.yaml`, please refer to our documentation: [docker_override](/docs/configuration/docker_override)

<Callout type="note" title="Söhne Font Licensing Issue">
During a recent license review, it was discovered that the Söhne fonts used in LibreChat require proper licensing for legal use. These fonts were added early in the project by a community contribution to mirror ChatGPT's aesthetic, but it was an oversight to allow them without proper knowledge.

To address this issue, the Söhne fonts have been removed from the project and replaced with open-source alternatives, effective immediately in the latest version of the repository on GitHub. The relevant font foundry has been contacted to resolve the matter.

All users and those who have forked LibreChat are required to update to the latest version to comply with font licensing laws. If you prefer to continue using the fonts, please follow the instructions provided [here](https://gist.github.com/danny-avila/e1d623e51b24cf0989865197bb788102).

LibreChat remains committed to ensuring compliance, accessibility, and continuous improvement. The effort to match OpenAI's ChatGPT styling was well-intentioned but poorly executed, and moving forward, all aspects of the project will meet legal and permissive standards.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in making these necessary adjustments. For updates or guidance on implementing these changes, please reach out.

Thank you for your continued support of LibreChat.
